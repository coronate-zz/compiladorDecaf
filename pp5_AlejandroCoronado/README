--------------------

In the PP5 project, the Three Address Code (TAC) are generated from AST.
Then the TAC are converted into MIPS ASM, which can be executed by the
SPIM simulator.

Step:
1. Check the existance of main function.
2. Assign offsets for class members and global variables.
3. Add prefix to all the functions and class methods.
4. Traverse the AST and generate TAC.
5. Generate MIPS ASM from TAC.

Note:
1. The signature of main function is 'void main() {}'. Each Decaf program
   must contain a valid main function.
2. Class methods are dynamically dispatched.
3. Interface and double type are not supported by compiler back end yet.
4. ReadLine function can only read strings which are less than 128 bytes, and
   it will alloc new space for new input strings.
5. Switch/case and postfix expressions are supported.
